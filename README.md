# Shelly IoT MQTT Dashboard

## Overview

This project is an IoT management system designed to monitor and control Shelly devices. It combines a robust backend built with Node.js and SQLite with an interactive frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project supports managing rooms, switches, and sensors, with features like real-time monitoring, historical data analysis, and MQTT integration.

---

## Features

- **Room and Device Management**: Add, update, and delete rooms, switches, and sensors via the Admin interface.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: View sensor data and device metrics on interactive charts.
- **Command Execution**: Send commands to devices via MQTT.
- **Data Analysis**: Fetch and display historical data for devices and sensors.
- **API Integration**: RESTful endpoints for frontend-backend communication.

## Project Structure

### Backend
1. **Main Server**
   - `server.js`: The central server script, handling API endpoints, MQTT command sending, and serving static files like HTML pages.

2. **Services**
   - `mqttServiceActive`: Contains logic to send MQTT commands to devices.
   - `mqttServiceAnalysisPassive.js`: Handles passive MQTT data processing, storing sensor values, and updating database records.

3. **Database**
   - SQLite databases (`iot.db` and `devices.db`) store room, device, and sensor data.
   - Database schema and initialization scripts provided in the repository.

4. **Dependencies**
   - Core libraries include `express`, `mqtt`, `sqlite3`, `dotenv`, and `body-parser`.
   - Listed in `package.json`.

### Frontend
1. **HTML Pages**
   - `index.html`: Main dashboard for room, device, and sensor management.
   - `charts.html`: Displays interactive charts for device metrics.
   - `admin.html`: Interface for administrative management of rooms, switches, and sensors.

2. **JavaScript**
   - `app.js`: Manages dynamic updates for the dashboard.
   - `charts.js`: Fetches historical data and renders charts using Chart.js.
   - `admin.js`: Implements CRUD functionality for administrative tasks.
   - `api.js`: Handles API interactions.

3. **CSS**
   - `styles.css` and `charts.css`: Define the visual design of the dashboard and charts.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js
- SQLite
- An MQTT broker (e.g., Mosquitto)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd <repository-directory>
   npm install
   ```

### Configuration
- Create a `.env` file and configure environment variables for the MQTT broker, database paths, and other settings.

### Running the Application

To start the application, it is necessary to execute three scripts: `server.js`, `devices_api.js`, and `mqttServiceAnalysisPassive.js`. These scripts work together to manage the backend, API endpoints, and MQTT data processing.

1. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

2. Start the devices API service:
   ```bash
   node devices_api.js
   ```

3. Start the MQTT passive analysis service:
   ```bash
   node mqttServiceAnalysisPassive.js
   ```

Once all three scripts are running, open `http://localhost:3000` in a browser to access the dashboard.

## Usage

1. **Dashboard**: View and interact with devices and sensors in the main interface.
2. **Admin Menu**: Manage rooms, switches, and sensors via the `/admin` endpoint.
3. **Charts**: Analyze device metrics and sensor data at `/charts`.

### Testing the Application

The application was tested using the following Shelly devices: **Shelly 1 PM Mini 3 Gen**, **Shelly PLUS 1 PM**, **Shelly PLUS ADD ON**, and the **DHT22 AM2302 sensor**. The testing setup involved electrically connecting these devices to a standard home AC network, with a single load (a lamp) used for operational verification.

The Shelly application was used to enable the MQTT protocol on the devices. Subsequently, the devices were managed locally through the implementation of a Mosquitto broker, which facilitated the communication between the application and the devices via MQTT. This setup allowed for thorough testing of the applicationâ€™s features, including real-time monitoring, device control, and data visualization.
